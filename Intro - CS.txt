Intro:
Imagine you are looking to travel to a new city or location - perhaps you are relocating for work, or simply a tourist.
You know nothing about this city - but wouldn't it be nice to simply go to one website, enter the location you'd 
like to learn more about, and receive a nice set of facts about that place?  Our website will also allow users to
register and post reviews detailing their experiences in these locations.  These comments can be moderated by
administrators, who will be able to see comments flagged by other users and delete them if they are in violation
of our code of conduct.  We intend to utilize various API's offered by API Ninjas (https://api-ninjas.com/), and time allowing, we hope to incorporate other apis to add more information to our website.
